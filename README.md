DevOps Playground 

Welcome! This repository collects various DevOps experiments, automation tools, and microservices I build along the way.
It’s not a perfectly curated monolith — more like a well-organized toolbox where every drawer contains something useful… or at least interesting.

Expect working code, half-finished ideas, proof-of-concepts, and the occasional “I’ll clean this up later” moment.

🧰 What’s inside

•	Ansible playbooks — reasonably clean, battle-tested, and occasionally creative.

•	Go microservices — compact, fast, and written with a healthy respect for the Go compiler.

•	Scripts & helpers — small utilities that automate the boring parts of DevOps life.

•	Infrastructure experiments — CI/CD pipelines, container setups, Kubernetes manifests, Terraform snippets, and other cloud-shaped toys.

Everything here evolves naturally:

“If it works well — it stays.
If it breaks — I fix it.
If I forget — it becomes a ‘legacy component’.”

🛠️ Why this repo exists

Because DevOps is a craft: you learn, you tinker, you automate, you break things, you automate more things.
This repository is where those experiments end up.
Some of them graduate into real projects; others stay here as charming technical fossils.

📌 Notes & policies

No formal license. Use responsibly and with a basic sense of self-preservation.

Documentation varies from “surprisingly clear” to “TODO: write docs”.

Pull requests are welcome, especially if they improve quality without unnecessary ceremony.

Humor is allowed, but production outages are not.
